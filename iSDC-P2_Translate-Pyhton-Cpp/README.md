## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to take the **python** code you wrote when you implemented the two dimensional histogram filter and translate it into **C++**.

After you review the Python code you will download some starter C++ code. Your job is to complete the functions marked with TODO comments until the histogram filter works as expected!

You can evaluate the correctness of your code by compiling ```tests.cpp``` and then running the output. Do this by running the following from the command line.

```
g++ tests.cpp
./a.out
```

### Evaluation

Once you have completed your project, use the Project Rubric to review the project. If you have covered all of the points in the rubric, then you are ready to submit! If you see room for improvement in any category in which you do not meet specifications, keep working!

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to the same Project Rubric. Your project must "meet specifications" in each category in order for your submission to pass.
