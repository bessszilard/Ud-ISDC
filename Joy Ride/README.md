# Your parallel park function is "correct" when:

* Your car doesn't hit any other cars.
* Your car stops completely inside the right lane.

Advice: Do the parallel parking manually, and record the movement with OBS recorder. 
After with VLC player you can play frame by frame, and determine the events based on position or time.
